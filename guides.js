He's the first American and the fifth person to summit all 14 of the world's 8000-meter peaks, all without the use of supplemental oxygen. He moved to Seattle in 1977 to study at the University of Washington and then at Washington State University, where he received his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. He began guiding on Rainier with RMI in 1982 and has participated in 30 Himalayan expeditions since 1987. Ed's first book, <i>No Shortcuts To The Top</i>, was a national bestseller. His newest book, <i>K2: Life and Death on the World's Deadliest Mountain</i>, is now available here at firstascent.com."

His decade of guiding with prestigious outfits such as Alpine Ascents International and Exum Mountain Guides has taken him to the tallest peaks of Boliva, Mongolia, Papua, the Alaska Range and the Himalaya. In his spare time, he has worked extensively with the Climb for Cancer and the Khumbu Climbing School nonprofits as well as teaching himself the intricacies of Nepalese politics and Nepalese history.</p><p>Personally, David has reached the summit of Everest six times, peaked out on Ama Dablam and made a summit attempt on K2 with Adam Knoff aimed at the Southwest Pillar Route. Morton is also a pro photographer respected for capturing stunning imagery of the world's best climbers on the world's biggest climbs. His 2011 focus is honed on climbing Makalu, the world's fifth highest peak, with First Ascent guide Melissa Arnot.</p>"

He has since pushed deeper into the Wasatch, started teaching for the Utah Avalanche Center and made the pilgrimage to Valdez, blending both mechanized and non-mechanized access. His brush with international celebrity hit when footage surfaced on the BBC of Coulter outriding an avalanche at Brighton, but the bigger news story is the burly first descent Coulter logged when we put him in a heli in Haines.

In the last year alone the 24-year old has compiled a speed-climbing highlight reel that includes soloing The Nose on El Cap in a day, setting a 59-minute record with Alex Honnold on Squamish's Grand Wall and sending Zion's Sheer Lunacy (5.12b), Moonlight Buttress (5.12+) and Monkeyfinger (5.12b) in one massive 18-hour link-up with Nik Berry. His breakout stretch also included a big wall, first ascent expedition to Venezuela, where his team completed an overhung 15-day, 21-pitch, 5.13a, A3 line they named Kids with Guns, which has been called one of the steepest big wall climbs in the world. For an expedition encore Earle headed north to Mt. Proboscis in Canada's Northwest Territories, putting up another bold new 2,000-foot, 15-pitch 5.12c free route in the Cirque of the Unclimables with a team of four. It's been a busy stretch for Earle, but when this rising trad climber is not setting records, sending the steepest pitches or sleeping on a portaledge, he finds time to play classical banjo and to test the physics of massive highline rope swings.

                "bioTxt": "<p>In the mountain disciplines, athletes often shout about their accomplishments. But Kyle Miller is one of a rare breed, a pioneering splitboarder who has quietly ticked off an impressive list of ups and downs in his home Cascadian range. A longstanding local at Crystal Mountain, WA, Kyle's split mission first ramped up during the 2007 season when he summited then shredded the five tallest volcanoes in the American Cascades. </p>  <p>Kyle hit full stride the following season, becoming the first documented splitboard to tick off the entire top twenty-five list of Northwest volcanoes. After recovering from that exhaustive feat, Kyle set his sights higher and pushed deeper tackling a massive project to shred the ten North Cascadian subranges. In the process Kyle has raised the splitboard bar, laying down more than one hundred defining lines that speak for themselves.</p>  <p>Check Kyle's profile in <a href=\"http://www.whereiskylemiller.com/?cat=108\" target=\"_blank\"><i>February's Backcountry Magazine</i></a>.</p>  <p>Read about <a href=\"http://blog.firstascent.com/2011/04/11/kyle-miller-skis-the-black-hole-couloir-on-bandit-mountain-deep-in-the-ne-cascades/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Kyle's Black Hole and Ulrich Couloirs descents</i></a>.</p>  <p>Track the progress of <a href=\"http://www.whereiskylemiller.com/?cat=101\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Kyle's North Cascade Ranges project</i></a>.</p>"
